<div style="max-width:800px;margin:auto;"><h1>Chapter 3: What the Clocks Hide</h1><p>The room beyond the doors.<p>Elior did not move for a long time.</p>

<p>The city lived again around him—engines roaring, footsteps passing, voices colliding into ordinary noise—but none of it felt real. His fingers remained clenched around the broken watch, its warmth pulsing faintly against his skin, as if it had a heartbeat of its own.</p>

<p>The Hour Returns.</p>

<p>He sat up slowly.</p>

<p>No one seemed to notice him lying on the sidewalk. People stepped around him with mild annoyance, unaware that time itself had fractured only seconds ago. Elior pushed himself to his feet, legs unsteady, and looked around.</p>

<p>Marin was gone.</p>

<p>“No,” he muttered. “You don’t get to disappear like that.”</p>

<p>The watch pulsed again.</p>

<p>This time, the world responded.</p>

<p>The sound around him dimmed—not stopping, but stretching, like audio dragged through thick water. Streetlights flickered. Shadows bent inward, pulling toward him.</p>

<p>Elior staggered back.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” he whispered to the watch.</p>

<p>The glass cracked further.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he wasn’t standing on the street anymore.</p>

<p>He stood in a room made of ticking.</p>

<p>Clocks covered every surface—walls, ceiling, floor—each one beating at a different rhythm. The noise was deafening, overwhelming, a chaos of time arguing with itself.</p>

<p>And in the center of the room stood his father.</p>

<p>“Dad?” Elior breathed.</p>

<p>The man turned slowly.</p>

<p>He looked older than Elior remembered. Tired. Lines carved deep into his face, eyes shadowed with knowledge no one should carry.</p>

<p>“You weren’t supposed to be here yet,” his father said.</p>

<p>Elior’s chest tightened. “You left. You just disappeared.”</p>

<p>His father smiled sadly. “No. I stayed where time broke.”</p>

<p>The clocks began to slow.</p>

<p>“The Silent Hour isn’t an accident,” his father continued. “It’s a wound. One caused by people who tried to control moments instead of living them.”</p>

<p>Elior remembered Marin’s words. <em>Your blood remembers how to break the rules.</em></p>

<p>“You’re saying this is my fault?” Elior asked.</p>

<p>“No,” his father said gently. “It’s your inheritance.”</p>

<p>The room shuddered.</p>

<p>Cracks split through the clocks as a familiar pressure filled the air. The sound of that wrong heartbeat echoed again, louder now.</p>

<p>“The Collector,” Elior whispered.</p>

<p>His father nodded. “It feeds on broken moments. And it knows you can create them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want this,” Elior said. “I just want things normal.”</p>

<p>“Normal is time pretending it’s not fragile,” his father replied. “You’ve seen the truth now.”</p>

<p>The ticking stopped.</p>

<p>Everything froze.</p>

<p>Then the darkness peeled itself open.</p>

<p>The Collector emerged—not contained by fog anymore, but fully formed. Tall, vast, its shape folding in on itself like a paradox given flesh. Where its eyes should have been, there were endless seconds collapsing inward.</p>

<p>It reached toward Elior.</p>

<p>“RUN!” Marin shouted.</p>

<p>She burst into the room like a crack in reality, grabbing Elior’s arm.</p>

<p>“You came back,” he gasped.</p>

<p>“I always do,” she said. “This time, you finish it.”</p>

<p>“Finish what?”</p>

<p>The Collector screamed—a sound like clocks shattering.</p>

<p>Marin pressed the watch into Elior’s chest. “You choose.”</p>

<p>The watch burned.</p>

<p>Elior saw everything then—every lost second, every stolen moment, every regret feeding the creature before him.</p>

<p>And he understood.</p>

<p>The Silent Hour didn’t need to be controlled.</p>

<p>It needed to be released.</p>

<p>Elior stepped forward.</p>

<p>“No more,” he said.</p>

<p>He crushed the watch.</p>

<p>Time exploded.</p>

<p>Light tore through the room, through the clocks, through the Collector itself. The creature unraveled, screaming as the stolen moments ripped free and returned to the world.</p>

<p>The silence shattered.</p>

<p>Elior fell.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes, morning sunlight warmed his face.</p>

<p>Birds sang.</p>

<p>The clock on the wall ticked steadily.</p>

<p>7:03 a.m.</p>

<p>He sat up in his bed, heart racing.</p>

<p>On his desk lay a single object.</p>

<p>A watch.</p>

<p>Whole.</p>

<p>Quiet.</p>

<p>And for the first time, not ticking.</p>

<p>Elior smiled faintly.</p>

<p>Some moments, he realized, were never meant to move again.</p>

<p>Outside, the world continued—unaware, alive, fragile.</p>

<p>The Silent Hour was over.</p>

<p>But time would never forget who had listened.</p><!-- AD PLACEHOLDER --><div style="margin:40px 0;border:2px dashed #444;padding:20px;text-align:center;">
