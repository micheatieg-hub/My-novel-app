<p>It wasn’t written anywhere, but everyone who lived long enough in Ashmere felt it—the strange moment when sound thinned and time hesitated.</p>

<p>Elior Ashen was awake when it happened.</p>

<p>Rain-soaked streets reflected dim streetlights outside his apartment window. The clock on his wall ticked louder than it should have, each second pressing against the silence of the room.</p>

<p>Then, at exactly <strong>3:17 a.m.</strong>, it stopped.</p>

<p>At first, Elior didn’t notice. Sleep still clung to him in heavy layers, dreams dissolving into fragments of sound and shadow. But something was wrong—an absence so sharp it cut through the dark.</p>

<p>No ticking. No hum of electricity. No distant engines from the city beyond the window.</p>

<p><em>Silence.</em></p>

<p>Not the soft kind that comes before sleep, but the absolute, suffocating kind that pressed against his ears.</p>

<p>Elior’s eyes snapped open.</p>

<p>Moonlight spilled across the narrow room, frozen like a painted scene. Dust motes hung motionless in the air. Even the curtain by the window was suspended mid-sway, caught halfway through a breath it never finished.</p>

<p>His heart began to race.</p>

<p>The clock on his bedside table stared back at him. Its second hand was trapped between ticks.</p>

<p>3:17.</p>

<p>“This isn’t funny,” he whispered.</p>

<p>His voice sounded wrong—too loud, too clear, as if the world had emptied itself just so his words could echo.</p>

<p>Elior swung his legs off the bed. The wooden floor was cold beneath his feet, colder than it should have been. He crossed the room and pressed his palm against the window.</p>

<p>Outside, the city of Virelia stood perfectly still.</p>

<p>Streetlights glowed without flicker. A bird hovered mid-flight above the rooftops, wings stretched wide, frozen like a statue.</p>

<p>Time had stopped.</p>

<p>The realization hit him with a wave of nausea.</p>

<p>This had to be a dream.</p>

<p>He pinched his arm—hard. Pain bloomed sharp and real.</p>

<p>Not a dream.</p>

<p>A memory surfaced then, uninvited.</p>

<p><em>If the hour ever goes silent, Elior… run.</em></p>

<p>His father’s voice. Low. Urgent. Years ago.</p>

<p>Elior swallowed and stepped into the hallway. The apartment building was frozen in the same impossible stillness. His neighbor stood halfway out her door, mouth open as if about to speak.</p>

<p>A single drop of water hovered in the air near a leaking pipe.</p>

<p>He touched it.</p>

<p>The drop shattered against his finger and splashed to the floor.</p>

<p>“So I can move things,” he murmured. “But time can’t.”</p>

<p>A faint pressure built behind his eyes. Then he felt it—a pull. Not physical, but insistent.</p>

<p>Downstairs.</p>

<p>Elior followed it.</p>

<p>The city outside looked like a museum of interrupted lives. A man leaned against a lamppost, cigarette inches from his lips. A child stood frozen mid-laugh, a red ball suspended above his hands.</p>

<p>And yet…</p>

<p>He was not alone.</p>

<p>A woman stood in the middle of the intersection.</p>

<p>Her dark coat moved despite the still air. Her hair shifted slightly, as if the world hadn’t fully claimed her.</p>

<p>She turned.</p>

<p>“You can move,” she said.</p>

<p>Elior’s breath caught. “You too.”</p>

<p>A faint smile touched her lips. “That makes two of us. Which means the Silent Hour has chosen again.”</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>She stepped closer. “The hour outside time. It doesn’t happen often. When it does, it wakes people who don’t belong where they are.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Marin Vale,” she said. “And if you’re smart, you’ll come with me before the Hour ends.”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t?”</p>

<p>Her gaze flicked across the frozen city. “Then time restarts… and whatever noticed you tonight won’t forget.”</p>

<p>Elior thought of his father. Of unfinished warnings.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Okay. I’m coming.”</p>

<p>Marin turned toward the heart of the silent city. “Good. Because this isn’t the first time your family has been awake when the world sleeps.”</p>

<p>Somewhere far above them, unseen and unheard, a frozen clock shuddered.</p>

<p><strong>The Silent Hour had begun to break.</strong></p>
