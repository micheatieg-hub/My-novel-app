<h1>Chapter 1: The Silent Hour</h1>

<p>

<p>It wasn’t written anywhere, but everyone who lived long enough in Ashmere felt it—the strange moment when sound thinned and time hesitated.</p>

<p>Eli Rowan was awake when it happened.</p>

<p>Rain-soaked streets reflected dim streetlights outside his apartment window. The clock ticked louder than it should ha

<p><p>The clock in Elior Ashen’s room stopped at exactly 3:17 a.m.</p>

<p>At first, he didn’t notice. Sleep still clung to him in heavy layers, dreams dissolving into fragments of sound and shadow. But there was something wrong—an absence so sharp it cut through the dark. No ticking. No hum of electricity. No distant engines from the city beyond the window.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Not the soft kind that comes before sleep, but the absolute, suffocating kind that felt pressed against his ears.</p>

<p>Elior’s eyes snapped open.</p>

<p>Moonlight spilled across the narrow room, frozen in place like a painted scene. Dust motes hung motionless in the air. Even the curtain by the window was suspended mid-sway, its fabric caught halfway through a breath it never finished.</p>

<p>He sat up slowly, heart pounding. The clock on his bedside table stared back at him, its second hand lodged between ticks.</p>

<p>3:17.</p>

<p>“This isn’t funny,” he whispered.</p>

<p>His own voice sounded wrong—too loud, too clear, as if the world had emptied itself just so his words could echo.</p>

<p>Elior swung his legs off the bed. The wooden floor was cold beneath his feet, colder than it should have been. He crossed the room and pressed his palm against the window. Outside, the city of Virelia stood perfectly still. Streetlights glowed without flicker. A bird hovered mid-flight above the rooftops, wings stretched wide, frozen like a statue.</p>

<p>Time had stopped.</p>

<p>The realization hit him with a wave of nausea.</p>

<p>He backed away from the window, pulse racing. This had to be a dream. He pinched his arm—hard. Pain bloomed sharp and real.</p>

<p>Not a dream.</p>

<p>A memory surfaced then, uninvited. His father’s voice, low and urgent, years ago.</p>

<p><em>If the hour ever goes silent, Elior… run.</em></p>

<p>At the time, he’d laughed it off. His father had always been a man of strange warnings and half-told stories. Then one night, he never came home.</p>

<p>Elior swallowed and stepped into the hallway. The apartment building was frozen in the same impossible stillness. His neighbor stood halfway out her door, mouth open as if about to speak. A drop of water hovered in the air near a leaking pipe, perfectly round, defying gravity.</p>

<p>He reached out and touched it.</p>

<p>The drop shattered against his finger, splashing to the floor.</p>

<p>“So I can move things,” he muttered. “But time can’t.”</p>

<p>Something about that felt wrong. Unbalanced.</p>

<p>A faint pressure built behind his eyes, like the air before a storm. Then he felt it—a pull. Not physical, but insistent, as if the world itself were tugging at him, urging him toward something unseen.</p>

<p>Downstairs.</p>

<p>Elior hesitated only a second before following it.</p>

<p>The stairwell stretched longer than it ever had, each step echoing too loudly in the stillness. When he reached the ground floor, the pull grew stronger, guiding him through the lobby and out into the street.</p>

<p>The city was a museum of interrupted lives. A man leaned against a lamppost, cigarette inches from his lips. A child stood frozen mid-laugh, a red ball hovering just above his hands. Everywhere Elior looked, motion had been stolen.</p>

<p>And yet… he was not alone.</p>

<p>A figure stood in the middle of the intersection ahead.</p>

<p>She was older than him by a few years, maybe early twenties, her dark coat fluttering even though there was no wind. Her hair moved, subtly, like it hadn’t received the same message as the rest of the world.</p>

<p>She turned.</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>“You can move,” she said calmly.</p>

<p>Elior’s breath caught. “You too.”</p>

<p>A small, humorless smile touched her lips. “That makes two of us. Which means the Silent Hour has chosen again.”</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>She walked closer, boots striking the pavement with real sound, real rhythm. “The hour outside time. It doesn’t happen often. When it does, it picks people who don’t belong where they are.”</p>

<p>“I belong just fine,” Elior snapped. “I’m not supposed to be—this.”</p>

<p>“None of us are,” she replied. “That’s the problem.”</p>

<p>She stopped a few steps away and studied him with unsettling intensity. “Did your clock stop at 3:17?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said slowly. “How did you—”</p>

<p>“Because it always does.”</p>

<p>A chill ran down his spine. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Marin Vale,” she said. “And if you’re smart, you’ll come with me before the Hour ends.”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t?”</p>

<p>Her gaze flicked to the frozen city around them. “Then time restarts… and whatever noticed you tonight won’t forget.”</p>

<p>Elior thought of his father. Of unfinished warnings. Of the pull that had led him here.</p>

<p>He nodded. “Okay. I’m coming.”</p>

<p>Marin exhaled, relief flashing across her face for just a second. “Good. Then listen carefully, Elior Ashen.”</p>

<p>His blood ran cold. “How do you know my name?”</p>

<p>“Because,” she said, turning and walking toward the heart of the silent city, “this isn’t the first time your family has been awake when the world sleeps.”</p>

<p>Somewhere far above them, unseen and unheard, the frozen clock shuddered.</p>

<p>And the Silent Hour began to break.</p>
