<h1>Chapter 2: The Invitation</h1>

<p>The first thing Elior noticed was the sound.</p>

<p>A low, distant hum—like the echo of a thousand clocks breathing at once.</p>

<p>It rose from beneath the streets as Marin led him deeper into the city, away from the places he knew and into alleys that felt thinner. The buildings leaned closer together here, their shadows stretched and warped, as if the light itself was uncertain where to fall.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” Elior asked.</p>

<p>“To the edge,” Marin replied without slowing. “Every city has one. You just never see it when time behaves.”</p>

<p>They passed a café with a shattered window. Inside, a woman was frozen mid-fall, coffee suspended in a perfect arc from her cup. Elior’s stomach tightened.</p>

<p>“Does anyone ever remember this?” he asked.</p>

<p>Marin shook her head. “Not unless they’re meant to.”</p>

<p>“Meant by who?”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly. Elior nearly ran into her.</p>

<p>“That’s the wrong question,” she said quietly. “Ask what instead.”</p>

<p>The street ended.</p>

<p>Not in a wall or a gate—but in nothing.</p>

<p>The pavement dissolved into a pale, shifting fog beyond its edge. No sky. No ground. Just emptiness, pulsing faintly with the same hum Elior had been hearing since the Hour began.</p>

<p>“This is the Between,” Marin said. “The place time goes when it forgets how to move forward.”</p>

<p>Elior stared. “You’re joking.”</p>

<p>“I wish I were.”</p>

<p>She stepped forward and didn’t fall. Her foot landed on something unseen but solid. She turned and gestured for him to follow.</p>

<p>Elior swallowed and stepped after her.</p>

<p>The fog parted slightly as they walked, revealing fragments embedded in the emptiness—broken street signs, half-melted clocks, doorways opening into nowhere. Each object glowed faintly, like a memory refusing to fade.</p>

<p>“What are these?” Elior asked.</p>

<p>“Lost moments,” Marin said. “Seconds that slipped through cracks. People forget them. Time doesn’t.”</p>

<p>A sharp pain bloomed behind Elior’s eyes.</p>

<p>Images flashed—his father standing in a room filled with ticking clocks, shouting over the noise; a door slamming shut; blood staining white tile.</p>

<p>Elior staggered.</p>

<p>Marin caught his arm. “Don’t fight it.”</p>

<p>“My father,” Elior whispered. “He was here, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>Marin didn’t answer immediately. Then she nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Elior pulled away. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Because if I had,” she said quietly, “you might not have come. And we don’t have time for hesitation.”</p>

<p>The hum deepened.</p>

<p>A crack split the fog ahead—not visible, but felt. Then came the sound: a heavy, rhythmic thud, like a heartbeat that didn’t belong to the world.</p>

<p>Marin’s expression hardened. “We need to move.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” Elior asked.</p>

<p>Something shifted inside the fog. Tall. Wrong. Its shape refused to settle, stretching and folding in ways his mind rejected.</p>

<p>“A Collector,” Marin said. “When moments go missing, it comes to reclaim them.”</p>

<p>The thing turned toward them.</p>

<p>Elior felt it notice him—not his body, but something deeper.</p>

<p>“Why is it looking at me?” he asked, fear tightening his chest.</p>

<p>“Because you don’t belong here,” Marin said. “And because your blood remembers how to break the rules.”</p>

<p>The Collector stepped forward. The invisible ground cracked beneath its weight.</p>

<p>Marin grabbed Elior’s wrist. “When I say run, you don’t hesitate.”</p>

<p>“Run where?”</p>

<p>She met his eyes, fear flashing through her composure. “Trust me.”</p>

<p>The fog twisted violently as the Collector lunged.</p>

<p>“NOW!”</p>

<p>Marin shoved Elior forward.</p>

<p>He fell—not down, but through.</p>

<p>Light and sound tore past him. For a single terrifying instant, every second of his life collapsed into one—every choice, every regret, every unanswered question.</p>

<p>Then—</p>

<p>Time snapped back into place.</p>

<p>Elior gasped, slamming into cold pavement as the city roared to life around him. Cars screeched. Voices shouted. Wings beat the air.</p>

<p>3:18 a.m.</p>

<p>He lay there, shaking.</p>

<p>Marin was gone.</p>

<p>In his clenched hand rested a broken watch, warm and faintly pulsing.</p>

<p>Etched into its cracked face were three words:</p>

<p><em>The Hour Returns.</em></p>
