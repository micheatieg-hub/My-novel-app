<h1>Chapter 2: The Invitation</h1>

<p>The morning after the Silent Hour, Elior Ashen awoke with a lingering chill in his veins. Time had resumed, but a subtle dissonance remained, like a note struck too long and left ringing.</p>

<p>He sat at the edge of his bed, fingers brushing the clock. It ticked normally now, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that someone—or something—was waiting just beyond perception.</p>

<p>Rain pattered softly against his window, as if apologizing for the night before. A small envelope lay on the desk, sealed with a wax stamp marked with a strange sigil he didn’t recognize.</p>

<p>Elior opened it. Inside, a note written in sharp, precise handwriting: <em>"Meet me at the heart of the city at midnight. Only then will the next hour reveal itself."</em></p>

<p>Questions swirled in his mind, but there was no time to waste. He dressed quickly, grabbing his coat and stepping out into the wet streets of Virelia. People moved unaware of the edges of reality that had frayed the night before.</p>

<p>The city seemed normal, but Elior knew better. He could feel it in the subtle flickers of streetlights, the way shadows clung a moment too long, the faint hum that thrummed beneath the surface of sound.</p>

<p>And then he saw her—Marin Vale—waiting at the fountain in the central square, her coat dark against the mist. She lifted a gloved hand in greeting, her eyes scanning the crowd until they found his.</p>

<p>“You came,” she said softly, a shadow of amusement on her lips. “Good. Time is not fully yours yet, Elior. We have much to prepare for.”</p>

<p>“Prepare for what?” he asked, heart racing.</p>

<p>“The Hour chooses again tonight,” she said. “And if we are not ready, it will choose without mercy.”</p>

<p>Elior swallowed hard. Memories of the frozen city, the halted world, and his father’s warning rushed back. He knew there was no turning back.</p>

<p>Marin led him through narrow alleyways, past the silent docks, and toward the old clocktower. Every step brought a sense of both fear and awe, the city itself seeming to bend around them.</p>

<p>“This clocktower has stood longer than anyone remembers,” she said. “It is one of the few places where the Hour can be confronted, understood… controlled, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Elior nodded, trying to absorb her words. The world around them hummed faintly, like it was holding its breath in anticipation.</p>

<p>They reached the base of the tower. The doors were massive, carved with symbols that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. Marin pushed them open, revealing a spiral staircase that twisted upward into darkness.</p>

<p>“Stay close,” she whispered. “And do not falter. The Silent Hour has a mind of its own, and it tests those who enter.”</p>

<p>They began to climb. Each step echoed in a hollow, stretching corridor. Elior felt the pull again, the same invisible tug that had guided him through the frozen city. This time, it was stronger, insistent, almost like a heartbeat.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” Marin asked, glancing back at him.</p>

<p>He swallowed. “I don’t know if anyone could be ready for this.”</p>

<p>“Then we will be,” she said. “Or we will fail together.”</p>

<p>As they ascended, the first chimes of midnight began to ring. Somewhere high above, the great clock shivered, and the city seemed to pause once more, caught between two moments, waiting for the chosen to act.</p>
